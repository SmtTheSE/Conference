# ByteMe: A Computational Intelligence Web-based Solution for Bridging Information Asymmetry in Emerging Real Estate Markets

## Abstract
Information asymmetry in emerging Southeast Asian real estate markets, notably the Philippines and Thailand, creates significant barriers to equitable investment and sustainable growth, as fragmentation in rental records and private transaction data often obscures true market value and fair-yield potential. To bridge these informational gaps, we introduce ByteMe—a multi-layered computational intelligence web-based solution that integrates a state-of-the-art LightGBM framework with proprietary Proxy Yield Modeling. The system is architected around four synergistic modules: Global Market Intelligence for predictive pricing, an Investment Opportunity Scanner utilizing a Sentiment-Aware Market Efficiency Index (MEI), a Cultural AI Assistant powered by Gemini 1.5 to interpret localized land laws, and a Dynamic Data Lab for automated schema discovery and model training. A longitudinal case study was conducted using historical property data from 2024 to predict 2025 market benchmarks; these results were rigorously validated against contemporary 2025 literature and media reports, confirming the system's high predictive stability (σ < 0.05). Critically, ByteMe identified significant valuation-to-listing price divergences in secondary metro areas like La Union and Iloilo, where community interest has outpaced market pricing. By establishing a computational ground truth honoring both empirical metrics and regional heritage, this framework democratizes institutional-grade intelligence for local stakeholders. It fosters long-term economic stability, reduces speculative inflation, and promotes a transparent investment ecosystem tailored specifically to the Southeast Asian cultural context, directly reflecting the conference mandate of "Weaving Ideas, Celebrating Cultures, and Shaping the Future."
