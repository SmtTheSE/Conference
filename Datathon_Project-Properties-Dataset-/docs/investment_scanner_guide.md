## 1. 🚀 High Yield Zones (The "Income" Factor)
**The Question:** *"If I buy here, how much rent will I collect every year?"*

*   **Metric**: **Annual Yield % (ROI)**
*   **Plain English**: This is your "interest rate" from the property. If you buy a house for $100,000 and the Yield is **7.2%**, you are effectively getting paid **$7,200 a year** in rent.
*   **The Goal**: Find areas where house prices are low but people are willing to pay high rent.
*   **"Entry" Price**: This is the "ticket price" to enter the market. Low entry prices (e.g., $40k) mean you can start investing with less savings.

## 2. 💎 Market Gaps (The "Bargain" Factor)
**The Question:** *"Is this area undervalued compared to its neighbors?"*

*   **Metric**: **Gap Potential Score**
*   **Plain English**: This is a "Treasure Map" score. A **high score (e.g., 29)** means the AI found a "Gap" in the market. It means the price per square meter is unusually low, but there is still healthy activity.
*   **Supply (Units)**: This shows how many real houses are actually for sale. 
    *   **The "Safety Check"**: If only 1 unit is cheap, it might be a mistake. If **43 units (e.g., Sungai Petani)** are cheap, it’s a verified market trend.
*   **The Goal**: Find "Hidden Gems" where you can buy property at a discount before the rest of the world catches on.

## 3. How the AI "Thinks" (The Scanner Logic)

### Stage 1: The Giant Filter 🧹
The AI starts by scanning over **50,000 listings**. It immediately throws away any data that is "Unknown," has zero price, or doesn't have a location. This ensures you only see high-quality, actionable data.

### Stage 2: The "Proxy" Detective 🕵️‍♂️
Some datasets (like the Philippines) show "Sale Prices" but don't show "Rental Rates." 
*   **The Problem**: We can't calculate ROI without rent info.
*   **The AI Solution**: We trained the AI on 50,000 properties in Vietnam where we *do* have rent data. The AI learned the mathematical relationship between a home's size, price, and its rent. It then applies this logic to estimate the rent for homes in Thailand or Malaysia. This is called **Proxy Yield Modeling**.

### Stage 3: The Ranking 🏆
Finally, the AI compares every city in Southeast Asia against each other. It ranks them based on:
1.  **Profitability** (ROI)
2.  **Affordability** (Entry price)
3.  **Reliability** (Supply count)
