### III. Abstract

Information asymmetry in emerging Southeast Asian real estate markets, notably the Philippines and Thailand, creates significant barriers to equitable investment and sustainable growth, as fragmentation in rental records and private transaction data often obscures true market value and fair-yield potential. To bridge these informational gaps, we introduce ByteMe—a multi-layered computational intelligence web-based solution that integrates a state-of-the-art LightGBM framework with proprietary Proxy Yield Modeling. The system is architected around four synergistic modules: Global Market Intelligence for predictive pricing, an Investment Opportunity Scanner utilizing a Sentiment-Aware Market Efficiency Index (MEI), a Cultural AI Assistant powered by Gemini 1.5 to interpret localized land laws, and a Dynamic Data Lab for automated schema discovery and model training. A longitudinal case study was conducted using historical property data from 2024 to predict 2025 market benchmarks; these results were rigorously validated against contemporary 2025 literature and media reports, confirming the system's high predictive stability (σ < 0.05). Critically, ByteMe identified significant valuation-to-listing price divergences in secondary metro areas like La Union and Iloilo, where community interest has outpaced market pricing. By establishing a computational ground truth honoring both empirical metrics and regional heritage, this framework democratizes institutional-grade intelligence for local stakeholders. It fosters long-term economic stability, reduces speculative inflation, and promotes a transparent investment ecosystem tailored specifically to the Southeast Asian cultural context, directly reflecting the conference mandate of "Weaving Ideas, Celebrating Cultures, and Shaping the Future."

### IV. Extended Methodology & Research Logic

#### 1. Proxy Yield Modeling (The Technical Innovation)
In many Southeast Asian markets, "Rent-to-Sale" ratios are non-obvious to the public. Our system uses a **Vietnam-Anchor Proxy**:
- **Dataset**: 50,000+ matched listings.
- **Logic**: The model captures the mathematical relationship between physical attributes (Area, Bedrooms) and yields. This curve is then calibrated to the local currency (PHP/THB) using real-time exchange rate APIs.

#### 2. Market Efficiency Index (MEI) - Beyond Arbitrage
The system identifies "Value Gaps" using the following formula:
`MEI = (Search Volume Index + Interest Density) / (Median Price Per Sqm)`
*Rationale*: Instead of just looking for "cheap" land, the MEI identifies areas where the **community interest** (demand) is rapidly exceeding the **current listing price**, signaling an ignored or undervalued zone primed for sustainable development.

#### 3. Cultural AI Integration (Celebrating Cultures)
To address the "Celebrating Cultures" theme, the platform incorporates a Gemini-powered Cultural Analysis layer:
- **Legal Interpretation**: Interprets the *Foreign Investments Act* and *Indigenous People’s Rights Act (IPRA)* to provide qualitative "red flags" alongside quantitative scores.
- **Heritage-Sensitive Valuation**: The LLM adjusts valuation models in areas of high cultural or historical significance (e.g., Surf towns in La Union), ensuring that development doesn't erase local heritage.
